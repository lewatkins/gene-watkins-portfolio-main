            <h3>Career Sysnopsis</h3>
            <p>I began my career as a mainframe programmer decades ago. I started developing mainframe financial
                applications in IBM 370 Assembler. After 5 years of programing in assembler, I decided to learn to code
                in COBOL
                because it was, at the time, the prominent language for business applications. Over the years
                I have worked in several industries, such as bankinf, health insurance, title insurance, automobile
                distribution, Public utility (Gas and Electric), airline, and retail to name a few.</p>

            <p>I decided to enroll in <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, to learn a new skill that will enable
                me to work on more modern projects.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to hire a seasoned mainframe developer with excellent web integration skills, I'm your
                man. I'm looking forward to helping you integrate your critical mainframe applications with web
                technology.</p>
